Programming / Coding Projects Completed While Attending UMGC 

Welcome to my portfolio of programming and coding projects completed during my studies at UMGC, where I majored in Software Development and Security with a minor in Data Science. This repository is a comprehensive showcase of various projects, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and robust database management using MySQL and Oracle. With a focus on languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript and a strong foundation in database technologies, these projects demonstrate my academic growth and the hands-on experience I've gained. Through these initiatives, you'll witness my journey from mastering the basics of programming and database queries to designing and securing complex software systems and analyzing large datasets. I warmly encourage you to explore these repositories, share your feedback, or propose enhancements. Whether you're a fellow student, a prospective employer, or someone with an affinity for coding and data, I hope you find value in my dedication to technology and my continuous pursuit of learning and excellence in software development and data science.
